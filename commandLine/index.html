Navigating the File System:
__________________________

Commands:
ls - the command line looks at the folder you are in, and then "lists" the files and folders inside it.
pwd - "print working directory" - It outputs the name of the directory you are currently in, called the working directory.
cd - "change directory" - switches you into the directory you specify.
cd .. - To move up one directory.
mkdir - "make directory" - It takes in a directory name as an argument, and then creates a new directory in the current working directory.
touch - creates a new file inside the working directory. It takes in a filename as an argument, and then creates an empty file in the current working directory.
ls -a - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories.
ls -l - lists all contents of a directory in long format
ls -t - order files and directories by the time they were last modified.
ls -alt - lists all contents, including hidden files and directories, in long format, ordered by the date and time they were last modified.

Information:
$ - shell prompt
-a - option.

Files started with a dot are hidden, and don't appear when using ls alone.

The -l option lists files and directories as a table. - seven columns separated by spaces. Here's what each column means:
1. Access rights. These are actions that are permitted on a file or directory.
2. Number of hard links. This number counts the number of child directories and files. This number includes the parent directory link (..) and current directory link (.).
3. The username of the file's owner. Here the username is cc.
4. The name of the group that owns the file. Here the group name is eng.
5. The size of the file in bytes.
6. The date & time that the file was last modified.
7. The name of the file or directory.


Viewing and Changing the File System:
____________________________________

Commands:
cp - copies files or directories. (source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument)
mv - To move a file into a directory (source file as the first argument and the destination directory as the second argument)
mv  - To rename a file - with the old file as the first argument and the new file as the second argument
rm - deletes files and directories.
rm -r - modifies the behavior of the rm command. (-r stands for "recursive") it's used to delete a directory and all of its child directories.

Information:
rm deletes files and directories permanently.

* - wildcards - select all file names.


Redirection:
___________

Commands:
echo - accepts the string "anyString" as standard input, and echoes the string "anyString" back to the terminal as standard output.
> - takes the standard output of the command on the left, and redirects it to the file on the right.
cat - outputs the contents of a file to the terminal.
>> - takes the standard output of the command on the left and appends (adds) it to the file on the right.
<  - takes the standard input from the file on the right and inputs it into the program on the left.
| - takes the standard output of the command on the left, and pipes it as standard input to the command on the right. 
wc - outputs the number of lines, words, and characters
sort - takes the standard input and orders it alphabetically for the standard output.
uniq - "unique" - filters out adjacent, duplicate lines in a file. 
grep - "global regular expression print" - searches files for lines that match a pattern and returns the results. It is also case sensitive.
grep -i - enables the command to be case insensitive. 
grep -R - "recursive" - searches all files in a directory and outputs filenames and lines containing matched results.
grep -Rl - -R stands for "recursive" and l stands for "files with matches" - searches all files in a directory and outputs only filenames with matched results.
sed - "stream editor" - accepts standard input and modifies it based on an expression,
sed 's/theSearchString/theReplacementString' fileName - s: stands for "substitution"
sed 's/theSearchString/theReplacementString/g' fileName - g: stands for "global"

Information:
standard input - abbreviated as stdin, is information inputted into the terminal through the keyboard or input device.
standard output - abbreviated as stdout, is the information outputted after a process is run.
standard error - abbreviated as stderr, is an error message outputted by a failed process.

> - overwrites all original content


Configuring the Environment:
___________________________

URL for nano learning:
https://www.nano-editor.org/

Commands:
nano - command line text editor.
Ctrl + O saves a file. 'O' stands for output.
Ctrl + X exits the nano program. 'X' stands for exit.
Ctrl + G opens a help menu.
nano ~/.bash_profile - ~/.bash_profile is the name of file used to store environment settings.
alias - allows to create keyboard shortcuts, or aliases, for commonly used commands.
source ~/.bash_profile - makes the alias available in the current session.
history - history of commands that were entered in the current session.
export variableName="VariableValue" - makes the variable to be available to all child sessions initiated from the session you are in. 
PS1 - is a variable that defines the makeup and style of the command prompt.
echo $HOME - HOME variable is an environment variable that displays the path of the home directory.
echo $PATH - PATH is an environment variable that stores a list of directories separated by a colon.
env - "environment" - returns a list of the environment variables for the current user.

Information:
Each time we launch the terminal application, it creates a new session. The session immediately loads settings and preferences that make up the command line environment.
The ~ represents the user's home directory.
The . indicates a hidden file.
The name ~/.bash_profile is important, since this is how the command line recognizes the bash profile.
environment variables are variables that can be used across commands and programs and hold information about the environment.
Usually the USER variable is set to the name of the computer's owner.
$ is always used when returning a variable's value.
