    <h3>Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>arrow function syntax - () => </li>
      <li>function declaration | function expression - arrow function is shorter syntax for function expression</li>
      <li>local Variable | global Variable</li>
      <li>Math.random() | gives random number between 0 &amp; 1</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Extra | Functions</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Primitive parameters are passed to functions by value | 
        an object (Array) as a parameter - the function changes the object's properties</li>
      <li>A function can refer to and call itself - the function's name | arguments.callee | 
        an in-scope variable that refers to the function</li>
      <li> A closure is an expression (typically a function) 
        that can have free variables together with an environment that binds those variables</li>
      <li>scope chaining</li>
      <li> JavaScript allows for the nesting of functions and grants the inner function full access 
        to all the variables and functions defined inside the outer function (and all other 
        variables and functions that the outer function has access to). However, the outer
        function does not have access to the variables and functions defined inside the inner function. 
        This provides a sort of security for the variables of the inner function.
        Also, since the inner function has access to the scope of the outer function, 
        the variables and functions defined in the outer function will live longer than 
        the duration of the outer function execution, if the inner function manages to 
        survive beyond the life of the outer function. A closure is created when the inner 
        function is somehow made available to any scope outside the outer function.</li>
      <li>The arguments variable is "array-like", but not an array.
        It is array-like in that is has a numbered index and a length property. 
        However, it does not possess all of the array-manipulation methods.</li>
      <li>Function Parameters - Default parameters - function a(x, y = 1) | 
	    Rest parameter - function a(x, ...y)</li>
      <li>Arrow function - Shorter function - => | Lexical this - self = this</li>
      <li>Predefined functions - eval() | uneval() | isFinite() | isNaN() | parseFloat() | 
        parseInt() | decodeURI() | decodeURIComponent() | encodeURI() | encodeURIComponent() | 
        escape() | unescape()</li>
    </ul>
