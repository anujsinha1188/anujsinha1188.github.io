    <h3>Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>app.factory to create a new service</li>
      <li>add dependency as - ['$http', function($http) { /* */ }]</li>
	  <li>addition in controller as - ['$scope', 'service', function($scope, service) { /* */ }]</li>
	  <li>Services are a way to make standalone communication logic which fetches data from a server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Extra | Using a Service</h3>
    <ul>
	  <li>directives are markers on a DOM element (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class) 
	    that tell AngularJS's HTML compiler ($compile) to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element (e.g. via event listeners), 
		or even to transform the DOM element and its children.</li>
		<li>What does it mean to "compile" an HTML template? 
		  For AngularJS, "compilation" means attaching directives to the HTML to make it interactive. 
		  The reason we use the term "compile" is that the recursive process of attaching directives mirrors 
		  the process of compiling source code in compiled programming languages.</li>
		<li>Normalization : The normalization process is as follows:
		  <ul>
		    <li>Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.</li>
			<li>Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.</li>
		  </ul>
		</li>
    </ul>
