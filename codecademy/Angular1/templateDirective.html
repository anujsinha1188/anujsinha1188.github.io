    <h3>Services</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>app.factory to create a new service</li>
      <li>add dependency as - ['$http', function($http) { /* */ }]</li>
      <li>addition in controller as - ['$scope', 'service', function($scope, service) { /* */ }]</li>
      <li>Services are a way to make standalone communication logic which fetches data from a server.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Extra | Using a Service</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>What are Directives?</p>
      <li>directives are <strong>markers on a DOM element</strong> (such as an attribute, element name, comment or CSS class)
        that <u>tell AngularJS's <strong>HTML compiler ($compile)</strong> to attach a specified behavior to that DOM element</u> (e.g. via event listeners),
        or even to transform the DOM element and its children.</li>
      <li>What does it mean to "compile" an HTML template?
        For AngularJS, <u>"compilation" means attaching directives to the HTML to make it interactive.</u>
        The reason we use the term "compile" is that the recursive process of attaching directives mirrors
        the process of compiling source code in compiled programming languages.</li>
      <li>Normalization - AngularJS normalizes an element's tag and attribute name to determine which elements match which directives.</li>
      <li>The normalization process is as follows:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Strip x- and data- from the front of the element/attributes.</li>
          <li>Convert the :, -, or _-delimited name to camelCase.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Directive types</li>
      <li>Creating Directives - directives are registered on modules. 
        To register a directive, you use the module.directive API.
        module.directive takes the normalized directive name followed by a factory function |
        The function is invoked using $injector.invoke </li>
      <li>When you create a directive, it is restricted to attribute and elements only by default.</li>
      <li>The restrict option is typically set to: 'A' | 'E' | 'C' - &gt;!-- directive: my-dir exp --&lt; | 
        'M' - &gt;span class="my-dir: exp;"&lt;&gt;/span&lt;</li>
      <li>These restrictions can all be combined as needed: 'AEC' </li>
      <li>When should I use an attribute versus an element? 
        Use an element when you are creating a component that is in control of the template.
        Use an attribute when you are decorating an existing element with new functionality.</li>
      <li>Isolating the Scope of a Directive - separate the scope inside a directive from the scope outside,
        and then map the outer scope to a directive's inner scope. </li>
      <li>the isolate scope of the directive isolates everything except models that
        you've explicitly added to the scope: {} hash object</li>
      <li>The scope option is an object that contains a property for each isolate scope binding.</li>
      <li>a scope prototypically inherits from its parent. An isolated scope does not.</li>
      <li>Creating a Directive that Manipulates the DOM - 
        link option to register DOM listeners as well as update the DOM. | 
        signature - function link(scope, element, attrs, controller, transcludeFn) | 
        AngularJS scope object - jqLite-wrapped element that this directive matches - 
        hash object with key-value pairs of normalized attribute names and their corresponding attribute values - 
        directive's required controller instance(s) - a transclude linking function pre-bound to the correct transclusion scope.</li>
      <li> When a DOM node that has been compiled with AngularJS's compiler is destroyed, it emits a $destroy event.
        Similarly, when an AngularJS scope is destroyed, it broadcasts a $destroy event to listening scopes.</li>
      <li>signature: element.on('$destroy', ...) | scope.$on('$destroy', ...)</li>
      <li>transclude makes it so that the contents of a transcluded directive have whatever scope is outside the directive</li>
      <li>&amp; binding allows a directive to trigger evaluation of an expression in the context of the original scope, 
        at a specific time.</li>
      <li>pass data from the isolate scope via an expression to the parent scope: 
        passing a map of local variable names and values into the expression wrapper function.</li>
      <li>require: '^^myTabs' - 
        The ^^ prefix means that this directive searches for the controller on its parents.
        (A ^ prefix would make the directive look for the controller on its own element or its parents;
        without any prefix, the directive would look on its own element only.)</li>
      <li>If it is necessary to reference the controller or any functions bound to the controller from the template, 
        you can use the option controllerAs to specify the name of the controller as an alias</li>
      <li>use controller when you want to expose an API to other directives. Otherwise use link.</li>
    </ul>
