    <p>Difference between Service and Factory</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Provider - services you can pass to .config() function</li>
      <li>Values - neat way to pass simple values.</li>
      <li>Factory - allow us to add some logic before creating the object. | 
        Gives us the function's return value ie. 
        You just create an object, add properties to it, then return that same object.
        When you pass this service into your controller,
        those properties on the object will now be available in that controller through your factory.</li>
      <li>Service - creates a service object by using 'new' keyword. | 
        Gives us the instance of a function (object)- 
        You just  instantiated with the ‘new’ keyword and 
        you’ll add properties to ‘this’ and the service will return ‘this’.</li>
