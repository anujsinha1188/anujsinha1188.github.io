        A hyperlink is a prime way in which users can navigate from one web page to another. A hyperlink can point to
        another web page, or website, or files, or even specific locations on the same web page.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Hyperlinks can be of any of the below types:
    </p>
    <p>
    <p>
        <b> Text hyperlink:</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        A clickable text is used to take the user to another web page.</br>
        Largely, we use text-based hyperlinks.</br>
        This text usually appears with an underline and in a different color.</br>
        This color mapping is automatically done by the browser for all text hyperlinks.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Image hyperlink:</b></br>
    </p>
    <p>
        A clickable image is used to take the user to another web page.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Bookmark hyperlink:</b></br>
        A clickable text/image is used to take the user to another part of the same web page</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Email hyperlink:</b></br>
        It allows users to send an email by clicking on that link.</br>
    </p>
    <p>
        <b> Contact number hyperlink:</b></br>
        It allows the user to call a number by clicking on that link.</br>
    </p>
    <p> Let us learn about Bookmark hyperlink through this demo. </p>
    <p>
        <b>Bookmark hyperlink:</b></br>
        When a web page is lengthy, we commonly come across icons or links that say "Go to Top" or "Go to Bottom". </br>
        Click on these links does take the user to the top of the page or bottom, as applicable.</br>
        Sometimes we also observe, on click of a text in the menu bar, the page auto scrolls to that particular section
        on that page. </br>
        This is achieved by using the Bookmarking concept and the same is implemented by using hyperlinks.
